# Asteroids
Asteroids is a game I made in Unity, based on the classic arcade game Asteroids.

## Game controls:
SPACE – shoot
UP – accelerate
LEFT and RIGHT – rotate

## Title and game over screen controls:
ENTER – progress through story/menus
ESC – Skip to game or go back to main menu
(These are explained on screen)
The user can also type their initials for the leaderboard

## Features
-Custom graphics made by me in illustrator and pixilart.com
-Custom background music made by me in FL Studio
-Title scene, game over scene
-An opening story
-High score list
-Multiple levels (asteroids and music get faster each 1000 points)

Known issues:
-If you manually edit the highscores.txt it will crash if not formatted correctly. If the game crashes try deleting the file

Asteroid explosions, ship respawn sound, and “bloop” sound when progressing through the story were all from the asset store - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/retro-sound-effects-22153
Ship shooting sound is my friend Mo saying “pew” pitched up an octave
